# COVID-19-EDA-Insights

This project explores global COVID-19 data to understand the trends, growth rates, and regional differences in case numbers. 
The goal is to identify which countries and WHO regions cases arestill growing and which have managed to slow down the spread.

## 🔍 Analysis Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualizations to reveal trends according to countries

## 📈 Key Findings

2) Papua New Guinea, Gambia countries are failed the control the new cases Because covid spread rapidly here
